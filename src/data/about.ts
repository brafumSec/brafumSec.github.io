  I received my bachelor's degree and doctor's degree in computer science and technology
  from Xi'an Jiaotong University and Tsinghua University in 2008 and 2022, respectively.
  I have more than 10 years of working experience on network security and 
  program analysis. My primary research area centers on identifying
  vulnerabilities within the TCP/IP protocol suite and other fundamental Internet
  building blocks, e.g., Wi-Fi, IPv4/IPv6, ICMP, UDP, and TCP. My work has
  received widespread recognition and has been published at leading
  network security conferences, e.g., IEEE S&P, USENIX Security, ACM
  CCS, and NDSS. I have reported over 50 TCP/IP vulnerabilities,
  contributing to CVE/CNVD and working with affected vendors for
  remediation.

  I have been honored with a number of awards: Frontiers of Science
  Awards by the International Congress of Basic Science (ICBS),
  Nomination for the Distinguished Paper Award of CCS'2020, ACM SIGSAC Doctoral Dissertation Award Runner-Up, and ACM
  SIGSAC China Doctoral Dissertation Award. The impact of my research
  has extended to the security community and industry, receiving
  acknowledgments and thanks from well-known organizations and companies
  like Qualcomm, Wi-Fi Alliance, Linux community, FreeBSD community, China Telecom, China Unicom, China Mobile, Huawei,
  Alibaba, H3C, Ruijie, and others. Technique communities and media
  outlets such as The Register and APNIC have also reported on my work.
